    "- Learn basics of coding in Python and R\n",
    "- Practical application of statistics and econometrics using Python and R\n",

    "- How to collect data online, clean it and use it.\n",
    "- How to visualize data (and tell a story with graphs).\n",

    "WARNING: I am not a computer scientist, which means the way I teach the course is not geared to understanding all of the nuances in python language. Rather, I will teach you pratical applications of python and R for economics - my goal is to teach you what I wish I learned in class. \n",

    "### Why Python AND R?\n",
    "\n",
    "- These 2 languages are the languages of data science, and quickly becoming the language of applied economics.\n",
    "- These 2 languages are complementary; IMO if you know python, you will quickly know R. \n",
    "- I use Python and R for different things, so there is some path dependency.\n",
    "    - Python for data wrangling, webscraping and visualization (and Machine Learning if you're into that)\n",
    "    - R for data analysis and visualization \n",
    "- I think it's possible to learn the basics of both, but this is the first time I'm teaching them together. Please be patient with me! If it doesn't work, we'll focus on just Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a versatile language and does much more than analysis. You can automate tasks, build software programs, apply artifical intelligence and machine learning techniques, program - and a ton of other things. It's a great code to learn because it's in high demand in the labor market for a broad range of industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**R** is a bit more limited, but is excellent for data analysis for a variety of fields. A broad range of industries use it, as well. Everything I teach today can be done in R, as well. Python's weakness at the moment is regressions, while R has a breadth of packages - and often the latest econometrics technique is already up on R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first half of the class will focus on basic coding principles in Python - we'll move into data wrangling, web scraping and visualization. The latter half of the class will be in R and focus on visualization and regression analysis. "
